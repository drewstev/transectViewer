A Matlab-based tool for processing single-beam bathymetry from Hypack

Similar to Hypack's single-beam editor, TRANSECTVIEWER is a GUI to process hydrographic data in a Matlab environmnent. 
Input files are expected to be from Hypack (.LOG,.RAW,.BIN).  To start TRANSECTVIEWER, unpack the zip contents and type:
